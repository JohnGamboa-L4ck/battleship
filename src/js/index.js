/* When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of
the Carrier, Submarine, Cruiser/Destroyer/Patrol Boat, or the titular Battleship. If all of
a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins. If all ships of
both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw. */
